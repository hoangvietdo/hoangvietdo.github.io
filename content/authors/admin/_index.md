### About me ##

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at iNCSL, Sejong University in Seoul, Republic of Korea, working under the supervision of Prof. Jin Woo Song.

My research focuses on artificial intelligence for robotics, with an emphasis on Kalman filtering, SLAM, state estimation, and sensor fusion using LiDAR, radar, cameras, IMUs, and GNSS.
